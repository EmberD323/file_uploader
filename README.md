file uplaoder project - to build a stripped down version of a personal storage service eg google drive.

//notes for me
npx prisma migrate dev --name name_name: updating schema
supabase storage set up - userid,folderid,filename
next steps:

1)problem - files are not uplaoding as actual files, something wrong with my upload -asked - DONE
4) figure out how download button should work - get a blob, how to turn that info file
5) fileupdate name needs to update filepath too
