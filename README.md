file uplaoder project - to build a stripped down version of a personal storage service eg google drive.

//notes for me
npx prisma migrate dev --name name_name: updating schema
supabase storage set up - userid,folderid,filename
next steps:
1) figure out cloud storage - i think change multler location 
2) rearrange upload file to upload to there
3)save new url to db path
4) figure out how download button should work
4)cant acces env for supabase key
